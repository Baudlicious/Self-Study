.*Week's Summary:*
This week was fairly straight forward, install a simple, non-infosec related Linux distribution on our chosen virtualization platform. For this I personally chose __*Manjaro*__ as I'm fairly comfortable with an Arch Linux based distrobution. I also used VMware workstation Pro to host my guest virtual machine(VM) on my host computer running Windows 10.

 
## Week Two
Week two required the installation of Apache to our selected Linux VM
